First we had to create our enemies. We created the mice and animations in maya and imported them straight into Unity. By looping the animation and dragging it onto our model in the scene we were able to have our mouse move. However, since the mice are randomly spawning into the scene we can not use this method of attaching animation and are currently seeking other methods. For this project, our main focus was figuring out how to randomly spawn them into the scene.
